# Bookstore APP
> A Single Page App built with React that allows users to keep a track on books anywhere fetching and storing data using an API.

## Built With :hammer_and_wrench: 

- **HTML/CSS & JS best practices:** Correct use of tags, elements, properties and syntax.
- **GitHub flow:**  Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- **Linters Check:** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.
- **Webpack:** Bundler form JavaScript files for usage in a browser.
- **REACT JS:** JS library used for the basic structure.
--**Redux:** A bundle to store states and cases available along the entire application.
